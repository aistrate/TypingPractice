- display underscore char ('_') separately, as a cursor (don't just append it to TypedText, but use the getRectangle method to position it on the screen)

- keep a MissingNewlines property in class TextBuffer; insert all missing newlines before showing TypedText on the screen, so that typed chars will always display on top of the originals (even after typing a printable char for a newline in the original)

- Tab chars ('\t') at the beginning of the line should advance the cursor to the first printable char (to be used with Code practice texts, e.g., Haskell or C# source code)
