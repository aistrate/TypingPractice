Zipped executables can be downloaded here:

* [Typist.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14656944/Typist/Typist.zip) -- all executables, including font installer (7 MB)
* [TypistLite.zip](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/14656944/Typist/TypistLite.zip) -- all executables, NOT including font installer (120 kB)


Main executables:

* Typist.exe -- practice your typing skills
* FontInstall.msi -- install 27 free fixed-width fonts (to be used by Typist.exe)

Typist.exe will work fine with the default fonts found on any Windows machine; installing the extra fonts will just offer more options.


Executables for creating practice texts (for use with Typist.exe):

* TypingTextCreator.exe -- import articles from Wikipedia
* SourceCodeTextCreator.exe -- clean up and format source code files, and split them into chunks small enough for practice; by default it assumes C-like syntax, but can also process other programming languages
* CharTrainingCreator.exe -- generate files with groups of random characters, for typing practice directed to particular characters (e.g., digits only)
